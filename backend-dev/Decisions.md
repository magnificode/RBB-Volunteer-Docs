# Decisions

All questions and concerns that have come up will be documented here along with their answers.

### What, if anything, should we do to safeguard the public-facing data on this site?

The data on this site was public to begin with.  Scraped from other public sites, or given to us to use publicly with consent.
Therefore, no actions to safeguard the company data on this site need to be taken.
This includes not needing to safelist/blocklist IP addresses with technology such as cloudflare.

We should, of course, be up front about data privacy and take all necessary precautions with any private information we may have.

### Why are we scraping data from public sites?

We are scraping data from public sites in order to jump-start this project with an initial set of data large enough to be useful to the visitors of the site.

Without this data, the goal of becoming a viable resource for those in need will be considerably more difficult to achieve.

### Do we need a server at all?

We have yet to identify any true need for a server at the time of launch.  All scrapers can be launched manually and from the developers local machine.

### Should we get consent from the businesses we list prior to listing them?

We've determined that consent is not required in the case where we are scraping publicly-available information from publicly-available websites.

We will, however, offer an option for a business to remove themselves from the site.

### How often will the scrapers run?

Initially just once at the beginning to seed the site with data.  We are unsure how frequently they will run after 
the initial launch, but right now we're thinking they will run monthly.
